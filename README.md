I'm trying to learn three.js and I needed practice with shadows and lighting effects. Most of the time was tinkering around with what would work, but eventually I created a sphere that bounces around a plane. That sphere doesn't actually cast a shadow as it is whats called a baked shadow. This is to improve performance and to get practice as well with baking both lighting and shadow effects
